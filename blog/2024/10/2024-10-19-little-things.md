SO, what exactly is "design"?

Hello, I'm Celio, call me Nutsu, you're in my blog and this is the _actual_ first post here.

TL;DR
Design is perfective.

The issue I see the most out there is that somehow the idea of "standard" became popular, every site/blog you see out there, in one way or the other, looks too much alike. Not that it's bad, it is jsut _blend_. But that's ok, as long as it remais clean and accessible, right?

The issue here lies in perfective; Who, where, when and why, is one reading the contents of said site/blog? Some might like it light, some might prefer it dark, some might enjoy small things, some might love huge thigns (fonts, text), some could be looking for a minimalist greyish look and feel, others might be Leprechauns and enjoy the rainbow. I believe that's when the standard's hit hard: light or dark theming, a single accent color; the usual navigation + hero + section > icons; grid; and so on.

### Is that so bad?

No, not at all, this post is not a rent. It is actually the opposite, but from a different perspective, although we enjoy the "minimalism" standard, we also could enjoy more "graphical" lookin sites, different kinds of animations, colors, well. The issue must always remains the same, of course: accessibility. It must be usable and enjoyable by all folks.

Heck, even this same blog you're reading is part of a concept, two columns, with hero being smashed in the navigation. I enjoy it. I am looking for a bit more colors, I've used to build sites with the minimal possible amount of colors, the monochromatic madness.
